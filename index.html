    question: "Among CH₃⁺, CH₃CH₂⁺, and (CH₃)₃C⁺, which carbocation is most stable and why?",
    answer: "(CH₃)₃C⁺ is most stable due to +I effect and hyperconjugation from three methyl groups."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Why is vinyl carbocation (CH₂=CH⁺) unstable?",
    answer: "Because the positive charge is on an sp² carbon next to an sp² carbon; no resonance or hyperconjugation support."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Predict the major product: 2-butene reacts with HBr in the presence of peroxide.",
    answer: "Anti-Markovnikov addition occurs; product is 1-bromobutane via free radical mechanism."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What happens if you treat 2-methylpropene with dilute H₂SO₄?",
    answer: "Markovnikov addition of water; forms 2-methyl-2-propanol."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Rank in decreasing stability: benzyl carbocation, allyl carbocation, tertiary carbocation.",
    answer: "Benzyl > tertiary > allyl, due to extensive resonance in benzyl."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Identify the nucleophile: CH₃O⁻ + CH₃Br → ?",
    answer: "CH₃O⁻ is the nucleophile, attacks CH₃Br in SN2 to form CH₃OCH₃."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Why does SN1 occur faster in tertiary halides than primary?",
    answer: "Tertiary carbocation formed in SN1 is more stable due to hyperconjugation and +I effect."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Which is more acidic: ethanol or phenol? Why?",
    answer: "Phenol, due to resonance stabilization of phenoxide ion."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Does nitro group increase or decrease the acidity of benzoic acid?",
    answer: "Increases acidity by -R and -I effect, stabilizing the conjugate base."
